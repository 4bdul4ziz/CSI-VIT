# VIT Freshers (Introductory)
Heya! We're a batch of freshman year students from VIT-C. This project idea of ours came up completely out of the blue, we were discussing about pineapple pizza on discord, at 2AM while solving assignment problems. One of us decided to procrastinate a bit and decided to watch some controversial mystery videos on YouTube. Suddenly, he decided that he'll screen share it on discord and yeah, we spent that night procrastianting along with him ;-;. This was during the brainstorming phase so, this night of procrastination influenced the project theme for us at the very least :) 

So, let's get "how we got this" out of the way and focus on what it actually is.

# Overview & Purpose
The main goal that was intended to be achieved in this project was to give whoever that plans to take a shot at this trivia to get a feel of what they'd potentially get on working with cryptographic projects, this is to encourage students to take on cryptographic careers and get an advancement on their puzzle solving skills, also, to solve fun internet mysteries like the cicada 3301 :D. We genuinely hope that this would enlighten their knowledge on the types or we can say the ways on which this could be potentially observed to crack the encryptions or learn how to encrypt via a reverse engineering learning step. For those who wants to step onto the internet puzzle hunting journey and embark it successfully with basic mysteries to induce a likelihood on the subject of matter.

# Tech Stacks / Softwares Used / Materials Used
We have used quite a handful of tools and tech stacks to make this possible, we used the python programming language to code out the core of this project wherein we used Microsoft's Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio and JetBrains Pycharm Professional and then the JetBrains WebStorm to create a part of the challenge website (the final level :D), used GitHUb pages to host the domain, sonic visualizer to visualize the diagram and coagula for creating the spectrogram where we embedded the solution. ASCII cypher for encoding the mysteries, discord for team coordination, a huge chunck of our time and some double extras on caffeine :).

Little to say, I like ramen and coffee. And maybe, play some fortnite once in a while? The future constantly iterates on the actions you take every second. Stay put as much as you can and be the one that could steer this change in a positive direction. That's all I could say? And yeah, you're always breathtaking! <3
