# Hint(s) 

A welcome note with a phishy tone that’ll ignite the adventure. It is a puzzle itself. This puzzle will lead into the a file in the internet with image that when opened using notepad, it will contain “(3rd most obvious character string)” characters that needs to be entered. Then lvl 1 will start.

## Level 1
1st level will start with a congratulations note and a reminder of upcoming adventure. Lvl 1 contains a cipher message displayed in the console, when de-ciphered, will lead into a link that will lead into a google drive account with a single image file that is to be downloaded.
 This image can be opened by any photo viewer but needs high thinking ability and open it with notepad. There will be ciphered texts (obviously), when de-ciphered, will lead into Neptune lemmino video, whose length is to be entered as integer to pass lvl 1.

## Level 2
“This one will be something different” <Caesar cipher ciphertext leading to Ozymandias with hint <ascicipher>“Live+Die+duration + 5294213560”</ascicipher>>
Following the poets name to Wikipedia, append Born year, death year and age and mathematically add 5294213560 to the appended 10digit result will lead to a number, enter the number to pass lvl 2.

## Level 3
There will be the github website link displayed in the console. After following the link, there will be an audio file that has to be downloaded and opened by a program like sonic visualizer or any online visualisation software with spectrogram. The spectrogram contain youtube link to the cicada3301. Enter the upload year. Hence final task is completed.
